# Tailwind Practice Project - Week 13 (100xDevs Cohort)

This project was created during Week 13 of the 100xDevs Cohort, where we were learning **Tailwind CSS**. After covering the basics, our mentor, **Harkirat**, challenged us to replicate specific designs using only Tailwind CSS—no additional logic. 

Instead of simply replicating the designs, I decided to take it a step further. Here's what I achieved:

- **Clean and Modular Code**: Designed reusable, generic components with a well-structured codebase.
- **Complete Features**: Implemented functional components like:
  - **OTP Input Component**: Built entirely from scratch.
  - **Progress Bar**: Fully functional and responsive.
- **Responsive Design**: Made sure the pages look great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **React Integration**: Practiced and applied React concepts learned in Weeks 9 and 10:
  - **Routing in React**
  - **Context API** for state management
  - React **hooks**: `useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect`
- **Assignment Enhancement**: Combined this practice with the Week 10 assignment, using Context API to lift the state and solve problems dynamically.

This project showcases how I not only learned Tailwind CSS but also leveled up my React skills by building fully functional components and solving practical problems.
